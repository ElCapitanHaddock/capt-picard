#### Ohtred was born out of my experience moderating very active Discord servers.
#### We all know that when the users start arguing, the mods step in.
#### But when the mods starts arguing, who steps in?
#### If you're a mod, you know my pain. And so does Ohtred.
#### With Ohtred, you can prevent this situation from ever happening. 
#### He prevents drama, builds consensus, and gives the mods peace of mind.

## NEW FEATURE! The Embassy üèõ
* The embassy can be set to any channel in your server. In it's description set the ID of another server with Ohtred
* If that server also sets up an embassy and puts YOUR ID in their description...
* Then any messages sent on either embassy will be sent to the other one.
* Use it for diplomacy, inter-server events, or even just plain fun

## Democracy!
* Propose ideas to the #mod-vote channel with a simple command  
* Upon reaching X :upvote: it is announced as a "Success" on the mod-announcements page
* Upon reaching X :downvote: it is "rejected" as a "Failure" on the mod-announcements page  
* Suggestions in #feedback (for non-mods) that go up to X upvotes are proposed as "petitions"  
* From my experience, even combative mods will accept a result that is automatically posted
 
## Damage Control
* Messages with X :report: reactions are automatically deleted and archived in #report-log
* Any attachments are externally uploaded to prevent CDN deletion
* The reported message's author is muted for X seconds  
* Auto-moderate channels with the Perspective API, along customizable metrics such as NSFW and personal attacks
  
## Metrics
* Auto-display the number of online users with a simple üî∫ prefix on a channel or category name  
* Analyze the chance of an announcement to be negatively percieved before sending it 
* Translate messages in dozens of languages from Welsh to Arabic to Yiddish to Tagalog
* Give distinguished users a command to ping mods with a canned alert (restrict mod pings to only alerts)  

## And More
* Generate meme captions for images
* Kick, ban, unban, role, and timed mute commands 
* Custom prefixes!
* A super sexy bot page
* A support server manned by my bro LunarShadows

## Coming soon!
