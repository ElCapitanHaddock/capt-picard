# The sharpest cat on Discord.
##### By Jeremy Yang
##### Captain Picard is the name of the project, Whiskers is its current live iteration

## ‚öñÔ∏è Judge
* Propose ideas to the #mod-vote tribunal with a simple command  
* They either pass or fail, which can represent anything you want
* Configure custom pass/fail thresholds
* Suggestions in #feedback that are popular enough progress as "petitions"  
* Due process means everything - whiskers holds the mod team accountable
 
## üì∞ Reporter
* React to an inappropriate message with enough :report: reactions, and Whiskers deletes it
* Then he archives it in #report-log (with image retention)
* Whiskers can also auto-mute reported users for a customizable amount of time
* Auto-moderate channels, alongside metrics such as NSFW or toxicity (and many more)
* He is constantly learning through Google's PerspectiveAPI

## üí™ Bouncer 
* You can tell Whiskers to auto-kick or auto-ban raiders
* Enable autorole, and optionally require joining accounts to connect an external account, preventing alts
* Allow mods to bypass anti-alt measures with a moderator password
  
## üåø Diplomat
* Interserver channels - Whiskers will help you operate EMBASSIES.
* Simple and intuitive to set up
* Messages sent on either embassy will be sent to the other one.
* Use it for diplomacy, inter-server events, or even just plain fun!
  
## üîé Detective
* Whiskers can tell you the chance of an announcement to be negatively percieved before sending it 
* He can analyze the contents of images, and grab text from them
* What's that? In the blink of an eye, Whiskers' can uncannily identify images
* Sniff out plagarism with the image locate command, or find similar images with the mirror command

## And More ‚ùó
* Kick, ban, unban, role, and timed mute commands 
* Minimalistic userinfo and roleinfo commands
* Auto-display the number of online users with a simple üî∫ category prefix
* Whiskers is multilingual - translate from Welsh to Arabic to Yiddish to Tagalog
* Custom prefixes
