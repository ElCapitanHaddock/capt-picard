##### By Jeremy Yang

###### Ohtred is a Discord bot that promotes democracy in a server, using proposals, user initiatives, and other features that allow moderator teams to quickly mobilize against poor behavior or suggest changes objectively.
### Current features:
- Proposing ideas to the #mod-vote channel
    - Upon reaching X upvotes it is "passed" and moved to the announcements page
    - Upon reaching X downvotes it is "rejected" and also moved
- All channels, emotes, permissible roles, and vote thresholds can be set by an admin
- Alerting moderators based on severity
- Suggestions in #feedback that go up to X upvotes are proposed as "petitions" 
- Messages with X :report: reactions are deleted and archived in #report-log  
- Analyze messages based on their toxicity and hostility (auto-monitoring TBD)
- If you wish to host your own version of Ohtred, here is a good tutorial: https://shiffman.net/a2z/bot-heroku/
