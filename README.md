# Captain Picard
#### by Jeremy Yang
###### Picard is a Discord bot that promotes democracy in a server, using proposals, user initiatives, and other features that allow moderator teams to quickly mobilize against poor behavior or suggest changes objectively.

### Current features:
- Proposing ideas to the #mod-vote channel
    - Upon reaching 5 upvote reactions it is "passed" and moved to the announcements page
    - Upon reaching 5 downvote reactions it is "rejected" and also moved
- Alerting moderators based on severity
- Suggestions in #feedback that go up to 5 upvotes are proposed as "petitions" 

```
Picard is hosted on Heroku. If you wish to host your own version of Picard, here is a good tutorial:
