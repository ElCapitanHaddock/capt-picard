### By Jeremy Yang

#### Ohtred was born out of my experience moderating very active Discord servers.
#### We all know that when the users start arguing, the mods step in.
#### But when the mods starts arguing, who steps in?
#### If you're a mod, you know my pain. And so does Ohtred.
#### With Ohtred, you can prevent this situation from ever happening. 
#### He prevents drama, builds consensus, and gives the mods peace of mind.

## Democracy! ‚úã
* Propose ideas to the #mod-vote channel with a simple command  
* Upon reaching the upvote threshold it is announced as a "Success"
* Upon reaching the downvote threshold it is announced as a "Failure"
* Suggestions in #feedback (for non-mods) that reach the upvote threshold progress to #mod-vote as "petitions"  
* From my experience, even combative mods will accept a result that is automatically posted
* Due process means everything - hold the mod team accountable
 
## Damage Control üî•
* Messages with X :report: reactions are automatically deleted and archived in #report-log (with image retention)
* Auto-mute reported users for a customizable number of seconds
* Auto-moderate channels with the Perspective API, along customizable metrics such as NSFW
* Turn on lockdown mode to auto-kick or auto-ban raiders
* Enable autorole, and optionally require new members to input a password 
  
## The Embassy (NEW!) üåø
* The embassy is a chat channel shared between two servers.
* Once you set up the embassy channel, set its description to the ID of the foreign server
* If both server embassy descriptions are set to the other server's ID...
* ...Then any messages sent on either embassy will be sent to the other one.
* Use it for diplomacy, inter-server events, or even just plain fun!
* It is secure, as the IDs have to be mutually set
  
## Metrics üîé
* Auto-display the number of online users with a simple üî∫ prefix on a channel or category name  
* Analyze the chance of an announcement to be negatively percieved before sending it 
* Translate messages in dozens of languages from Welsh to Arabic to Yiddish to Tagalog
* Give distinguished users a command to ping mods with a canned alert

## And More üìã
* Generate meme captions for images
* Kick, ban, unban, role, and timed mute commands 
* Custom prefixes!
* A super sexy bot page
* A support server manned by my bro LunarShadows

## Coming soon!
- natural.js machine-learning word censorship
