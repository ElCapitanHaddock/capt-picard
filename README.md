#### Ohtred was born out of my experience moderating very active Discord servers.
#### We all know that when the users start arguing, the mods step in.
#### But when the mods starts arguing, who steps in?
#### If you're a mod, you know my pain. And so does Ohtred.
#### With Ohtred, you can prevent this situation from ever happening. 
#### He promotes discussion, builds consensus, and gives the mods peace of mind.

### Democracy!
* Propose ideas to the #mod-vote channel with a simple command  
* Upon reaching X :upvote:s it is announced as a "Success" on the mod-announcements page
* Upon reaching X :downvote:s it is "rejected" as a "Failure" on the mod-announcements page  
* Suggestions in #feedback (for non-mods) that go up to X upvotes are proposed as "petitions"  
 
### Damage Control
* Messages with X :report: reactions are automatically deleted and archived in #report-log
* Any attachments are externally uploaded to prevent CDN deletion
* The reported message's author is muted for X seconds  
* Auto-moderate channels with the Perspective API, along customizable metrics such as NSFW and personal attacks
  
### Metrics
* Auto-display the number of online users with a simple ðŸ”º prefix on a channel or category name  
* Analyze the chance of an announcement to be negatively percieved before sending it 
* Translate messages in dozens of languages from Welsh to Arabic to Yiddish to Tagalog
* Give distinguished users a command to ping mods with a canned alert (restrict mod pings to only alerts)  

### Upcoming Features:
- Auto-generated external IP verification pages for banned users making an appeal
- Auto-translators in channels where it is enabled
